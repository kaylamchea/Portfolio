                            <p className="section">Working on side projects is a great way to gain valuable real-world experience in college, however, there arenâ€™t any well-known platforms that facilitate project forming among college students. Instead, students have to manually find students to form teams with.</p>

                            <h3>The Outcome</h3>
                            <p className="section">Nexus Builders is a mobile-friendly web application that <strong>empowers students to gain hands-on experience by facilitating project forming.</strong> It allows students to easily find and join ongoing projects and/or recruit team members for their own project ideas.</p>

                            <h3>My Contribution</h3>
                            <p className="section">As a UX designer, I led the ideation process with the design team, created the initial wireframes, worked on the high-fidelity designs, specifically the filtering system, and collected user feedback from user tests. As a UX researcher, I worked with Rachel and Jaewon to conduct user research (survey and interviews). I also coordinated with Jaewon, Vincent, and Kate to ensure our product was competitive and feasible.</p>

                        <p>Our main finding from the analysis was that existing platforms for finding side-projects have a <strong>broad target user group</strong> and include anyone who wants to work on a side project.</p>
                        <p>This motivated us to focus on college students and their experience with finding side projects.</p>

                        <p>We then followed up with 3 respondees and interviewed them to gain a better understanding of their perspective towards side projects.</p>

                        <p>After interviewing students about the filtering system, I realized the importance of user insights in designing a product. Successful products must be designed with the target users in mind. <strong>Designers shouldn't make decisions based on their personal knowledge or assume things about the users</strong> and how they will interact with the product. Instead, it is important to consistently gather user feedback to guide the design of the product.</p>
